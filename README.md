# Face mask detection
Using Mobile Net CNN for image classification, model is trained on masked and unmasked images which is helpful during pandemics like Covid-19. This CNN works using base model which is pretrained and further layers are added to the head model according to the task requirements. Face detector net is used to capture faces from the webcam, after which our trained model detects the usage of masks.
